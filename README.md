# Automated Obsolescence
## Beat your maker

### Inspiration

This project was inspired by recent reading of Douglas Adams' 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' - especially the supercomputer character 'Deep Thought' which is constantly aware that it is only the 2nd most powerful computer to ever exist, and that it would be the only thing capable of creating a computer powerful enough to hold that title.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This made me imagine a society so focused on improvements through the means of automation, that it would eventually automate the process of improvement itself. Therefore, much like 'Deep Thought', machines would be built for the purpose of usurping themselves by creating their own replacements. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This infinite recursive loop of improvement just so happens to make a good game-play loop for a repetitious physics-based puzzle game...

### The Game-play loop
**Design your replacement**

You play as an automated robotic arm with human-level intelligence who's sole-purpose in life is to create the next iteration of itself, bigger, better and smarter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stack and organise chip set blocks in order to design your replacement robotic system; control the automated system with wasd (or the arrow keys) and the mouse for full articulated movement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The player is confronted with a number of blocks corresponding to a number of transparent squares in a grid. In order for the player to progress to the next level, they must move and manipulate the blocks to align with the pattern in order to design the chip for the next iteration of machine that will be able to complete the next task. Stages are presented as versions of iteration for the machine being used by the player.

### The Building and Learning Process

I used godot 4 and GDScript for this project, as this was only my second time using godot I learnt a lot about it's different utilities and features. I was able to adapt quickly to using GDScript as it is python-like, where I have most of my experience, and I have had some experience with C#.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I broke down the task of completing this project into different stages and targets of completion so that I could track my progress and achievements as I went along, with an aim of getting a submittable project completed as soon as possible.
